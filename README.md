# new-arcade-game
Project for the Udacity Nanodegree
This Udacity project was focused on JavaScript. Principally on classes and prototypes for creating a game on canvas. 

## Installation requirements
There are no installation requirements. You only need a browser. If you do not want to use the [link of the game](https://efectusmagnus.github.io/html/arcade-game.html), and would rather have it locally, you only need to download it to your computer and run the index.html with a browser. 

## How to play the game
If the player is on a desktop, he will be able to use the arrow keys to move on the game board. And if he is on a mobile device, he will be able to use the control buttons. There is also a reset button beside the score panel for both desktop and mobile devices. 

To win the game, the player must reach 20 points. To gain such points, he can reach the water and/or collect gems. Each time he reaches the water, he gets reseted, but not when he collects gems. His enemies are the bugs. If the player collides with a bug, he will lose a heart at every collision. When he loses his three hearts, he dies, and the game is over.
